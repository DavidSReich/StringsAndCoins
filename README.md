Stellar Dots & Boxes
Stellar Dots & Boxes was developed in Objective-C.
This is an expanded version of Dots & Boxes, which is a pencil-and-paper game called Pig or Pen-the-Pig or or Boxes or ...  Stellar Dots & Boxes has several unique features.
It has triangular and hexagonal playing grids in addition to the usual square grid, and all three grids can be played in three different sizes.  I've also implemented a "strings-and-coins" variant, which is also unique.
There are also seven different colour palettes which were designed to be distinct for people with impaired colour vision.
Stellar Dots & Boxes can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players or against the AI.
It was conceived as a social game with players sitting together around an iPad (or iPhone).
This app uses the Foundation and the UIKit.
The iPad version was designed for the larger playing area and is not just a larger implementation of the iPhone version.
